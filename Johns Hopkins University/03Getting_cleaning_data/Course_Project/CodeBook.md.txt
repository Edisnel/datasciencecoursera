Getting and Cleaning Data. Course Project Codebook

The original (raw) data processed is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The link to this dataset on Coursera to made this work is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

In this original dataset for each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. For more information consult the README and features_info files of this dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Tidy Data Set

This tidy data set was obtenied by merging the files Y_test.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, X_train.txt from the original dataset. Then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the original dataset. This data was wrote it to a file named tidy_dataset.txt. 

For each record in the file tidy_dataset.txt it is provided:
===========================================================
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables filtered from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (the original dataset). Mean and Std variables
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (30 subject with numbers from 1 to 30)
- Activity label with six values:(WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING)

Per each column in tidy_dataset.txt file we have the following variables:

Second data set

It was obtained a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the tidy data set described above.

This data set contains 180 rows and 68 columns, stored in the file second_dataset.txt
